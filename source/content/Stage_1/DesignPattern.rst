learn from others
=================

When designing a product, have a look at similiar products. Check which have failed and which have successed; learn from the successful projects. Don't succumb to Not Invented Here syndrome. Reuse the ideas, the APIs, the conceptual frameworks, whatever you find appropriate. By doing so you are allowing users to reuse their existing knowledge. At the same time, you may be avoiding technical pitfalls you are not even ware of at the moment.


When solving a complex and multi-faceted problem it may turn out that a monlithic general purpose solution may not be the best way to go. Instead, we can think of the problem area as an abstract layer and provide multiple implementations of this layer, each focused on a specific well-defined use case. When doing so, delineate the use case carefully. Be sure about what is in the scope and what is not. By restricting the use case too aggressively the application of you software maybe limited. If you define the problem too broadly, however, the product may become too complex blurry and confusing for the users.
